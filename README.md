# IEB FHIR

This project is a complete starter project you can use to deploy a FHIR server using HAPI FHIR JPA.

Note that this project is specifically intended for end users of the HAPI FHIR JPA server module (in other words, it helps you implement HAPI FHIR, it is not the source of the library itself). If you are looking for the main HAPI FHIR project, see here: https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir

## Prerequisites

In order to use this sample, you should have:

- [This project](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter) checked out. You may wish to create a GitHub Fork of the project and check that out instead so that you can customize the project and save the results to GitHub.
- Oracle Java (JDK) installed: Minimum JDK8 or newer.
- Apache Maven build tool (newest version)
